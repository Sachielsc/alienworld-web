加入我的linux心得：
Use aptitude instead of apt-get. It is more intelligent. It not only will handle downgrading conflicting packages for you, but will make a series of recommendations asking you which of many possible suggested working scenarios you would like.

sudo aptitude install myNewPackage
If you don't have aptitude on your machine yet, get it with

sudo apt-get install aptitude
