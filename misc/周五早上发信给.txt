Hi Amrita,

Haven't heard from you for days. Is everything okay? Hope everything goes well and looking forward to hear from you again :)

It is so excited to hear about the opportunity from you on this Tuesday. I sent a modified CV with full experience in details to the Email address of AskNicely on Wednesday.

I start my coding intern experience and some of my self-motivated projects long before I graduate. I love development thus I keep practicing it every day. But my goal is certainly to put this enthusiasm in a real work with real challenges, and that is why I am so excited about this opportunity.

Wish everything goes well. If you have further questions, please feel free to contact me.
