    <h4 class="hidethis">自学总体思路：(2017年初)</h4>
    <p class="hidethis">
      我觉得你可以先学一下前端知识，从平面设计开始、再学html、css、js，接着学后端的开发语言，比如php、python、ruby、java等都不错，让后了解一些数据库，服务器，linux的知识，这样整个互联网开发你都能有一个认识。</p>

    <h4>Concepts:</h4>
    <dl>
      <dt>Apache:</dt>
      <dd>Apache is the most widely used web server software. Developed and maintained by Apache Software
        Foundation, Apache is an open source software available for free. It runs on 67% of all webservers in
        the world. It is fast, reliable, and secure. It can be highly customized to meet the needs of many
        different environments by using extensions and modules. Most WordPress hosting providers use Apache as
        their web server software. However, WordPress can run on other web server software as well.
      </dd>
      <dt>API:</dt>
      <dd>Application programming interface: A set of functions and procedures that allow the creation of
        applications which access the features or data of an operating system, application, or other service.
      </dd>
      <dt>Responsive Web Design：</dt>
      <dd>Responsive web design is about creating web sites which automatically adjust themselves to look good on
        all devices, from small phones to large desktops.
      </dd>
      <dt>Node.js</dt>
      <dd>Node.js is an open source, cross-platform runtime environment for developing server-side and networking
        applications. Node.js applications are written in JavaScript, and can be run within the Node.js runtime
        on OS X, Microsoft Windows, and Linux.<br>
        Node.js also provides a rich library of various JavaScript modules which simplifies the development of
        web applications using Node.js to a great extent.<br>
        Node.js = Runtime Environment + JavaScript Library
      </dd>
      <dt>Express.js</dt>
      <dd>Express.js is a Node.js framework. It's the most popular framework as of now. Some say express.js is to
        Node.js what Ruby on Rails or Sinatra is to Ruby. Express 3.x is a light-weight web application
        framework to help organize your web application into an MVC architecture on the server side. You can use
        a variety of choices for your templating language (like EJS, Jade, and Dust.js).
      </dd>
      <dt>Maven</dt>
      <dd>Maven is a build automation tool used primarily for Java projects.<br>
        Maven addresses two aspects of building software: first, it describes how software is built, and second,
        it describes its dependencies. Contrary to preceding tools like Apache Ant, it uses conventions for the
        build procedure, and only exceptions need to be written down. An XML file describes the software project
        being built, its dependencies on other external modules and components, the build order, directories,
        and required plug-ins. <br>
        Maven can also be used to build and manage projects written in C#, Ruby, Scala, and other languages. The
        Maven project is hosted by the Apache Software Foundation.
      </dd>
      <dt>npm</dt>
      <dd>npm, short for Node Package Manager, is two things: first and foremost, it is an online repository for
        the publishing of open-source Node.js projects; second, it is a command-line utility for interacting
        with said repository that aids in package installation, version management, and dependency management.
      </dd>
      <dt>Spring</dt>
      <dd>The Spring Framework is an application framework and inversion of control container for the Java
        platform. The framework's core features can be used by any Java application, but there are extensions
        for building web applications on top of the Java EE platform.
      </dd>
      <dt>JPA</dt>
      <dd>The Java Persistence API (JPA) is a Java specification for accessing, persisting, and managing data
        between Java objects / classes and a relational database. JPA was defined as part of the EJB 3.0
        specification as a replacement for the EJB 2 CMP Entity Beans specification. JPA is now considered the
        standard industry approach for Object to Relational Mapping (ORM) in the Java Industry.<br>
        JPA itself is just a specification, not a product; it cannot perform persistence or anything else by
        itself. JPA is just a set of interfaces, and requires an implementation. There are open-source and
        commercial JPA implementations to choose from and any Java EE 5 application server should provide
        support for its use. JPA also requires a database to persist to.
      </dd>
      <dt>REST</dt>
      <dd>REST is an architecture style for designing networked applications. The idea is that, rather than using
        complex mechanisms such as CORBA, RPC or SOAP to connect between machines, simple HTTP is used to make
        calls between machines.<br>
        In many ways, the World Wide Web itself, based on HTTP, can be viewed as a REST-based architecture.<br>
        RESTful applications use HTTP requests to post data (create and/or update), read data (e.g., make
        queries), and delete data. Thus, REST uses HTTP for all four CRUD (Create/Read/Update/Delete)
        operations.<br>
        REST is a lightweight alternative to mechanisms like RPC (Remote Procedure Calls) and Web Services
        (SOAP, WSDL, et al.). Later, we will see how much more simple REST is.<br>
        Despite being simple, REST is fully-featured; there's basically nothing you can do in Web Services that
        can't be done with a RESTful architecture.
