                <p>◆JavaScript asynchronous:<br>
                In asynchronous programs, you can have two lines of code (L1 followed by L2), where L1 schedules some task to be run in the future, but L2 runs before that task completes.<br>
                <br>
                JavaScript can have asynchronous code, but it is generally single-threaded.<br>

                Asynchronous code needs to be structured in a different way than synchronous code, and the most basic way to do that is with callback functions.<br>
                JavaScript callback:<br>
                <br>
                JavaScript promise:<br>
                Promises are a popular way of getting rid of callback hell. <br>

                <br>
                HTTP methods:<br>
                get/put/delete<br>
                URL: <i>https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_httpmethods.asp</i><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>GET - Requests data from a specified resource</li>
                    <li>POST - Submits data to be processed to a specified resource</li>
                    <li>PUT – uploads a representation of the specified URI</li>
                    <li>DELETE – deletes a specified resource</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
