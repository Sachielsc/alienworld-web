      <li>There is no connection between the assigned mission on Gitlab and the commit on Git<br>
        Can not achieve this goal, no such function. <br>
        Reason: the gitlab only supplies a platform for project management. While we use git to commit and push
        our codes into database. Suggestion: always clarify what we have done before we push.
      </li>

        API is the interface which connects the back-end data and front-end page. In our website, the API
