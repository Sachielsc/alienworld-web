        <h3>Meeting 10: May 27th</h3>
        <h4>Aaron's suggestion &amp; mission</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Always remember to use 4 spaces for indentation, instead of tabs!<br>
                <i>Reason: the spaces have much better compatibility in different compilers</i>
            </li>
            <li>In my html files, should break lines between different elements/tagnames</li>
            <li>Need to correct the logic in my js code:<br>
                <i>Check our code in the following file:<br>
                    D:\alienworld\alienworld-web\webapp\app\modules\selling\controllers\product-add.controller.js:<br>
                    The product id is get by &quot;$scope.pid = $state.params.pid;&quot;<br>
                    I shall make the url of my itemdetail page as &quot;itemDetail?pid=1&quot;</i></li>
        </ul>

        <h4>About our project: Efficiency and teamwork</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The progress of our project is slow.</li>
            <li>Solution: We need to bring in standardized and industrialized developing procedures</li>
            <li>Solution: We need to designate someone to follow each team member&apos;s progress, set deadlines and
                ensure the whole project&apos;s running
            </li>
