        <h3>Meeting 12: Jun 10th</h3>
        <h4>About our project: Kedar and Jessica are joining our team and making the progress faster.</h4>
        <h4>A deeper understanding and use of Git:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>About git add: <code>git add -A</code> is equivalent to <code>git add .</code>. These two commands add
                all modified and new (untracked) files in the current directory and all subdirectories to the staging
                area (a.k.a. the index), thus preparing them to be included in the next git commit
            </li>
            <li>Set an alias for complicated git commands: <code>git config --global alias.st status</code></li>
            <li>The difference between <code>git pull</code> and <code>git rebase</code>: when you pull your code from
                dev branch to master branch, it will only generate one commit on the master branch declaring all the
                modifications on the dev branch; while when you rebase your code from dev branch to master branch, it
                will bring all those commits on the dev branch to this master branch. <b>In a nutshell, use <code>git
                    rebase</code>.</b></li>
            <li>Three ways to make a change on a previous commit:
                <ol>
                    <li><code>Git revert</code>: Reverting undoes a commit by creating a new commit. This is a safe way
                        to undo changes, as it has no chance of re-writing the commit history.
                    </li>
                    <li><code>Git reset</code>: move the head to the location where when the last change of this commit
                        is done, also the next modifications in the following commits <b>will EXIST as unstaged
                            changes.</b></li>
                    <li><code>Git checkout</code>: This <code>git checkout &lt;commit&gt;</code> command can let you
                        enter a 'detached HEAD' state to the commit position, where when the last change of this commit
                        is done. You can look around, make experimental changes and commit them, and you can discard any
                        commits you make in this state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.
                        Remember: Use this command <b>only</b> when you need to check previous code.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Three distinct uses of <code>git checkout</code>:
                <ol>
                    <li><code>git checkout &lt;branch&gt;</code>: To prepare for working on &lt;branch&gt;, switch to it
                        by updating the index and the files in the working tree, and by pointing HEAD at the branch.
                    </li>
                    <li><code>git checkout &lt;filename&gt;</code>: For those changed file that is TRACKED, i.e. changes
                        that is not staged for commit yet, using this command will ERASE all the changes in working
                        directory. For those files that are already staged, <code>git checkout &lt;filename&gt;</code>
                        is useless. We can only use <code>git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;</code> to unstage this file. And
                        this command <code>git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;</code> will not change this file, only unstage it
                        and put it back to "Tracked files: changes not staged for commit" or "untracked files"
                    </li>
                    <li>git checkout &lt;commit&gt;: Enter a 'detached HEAD' state to the commit position, where when
                        the last change of this commit is done. You can look around, make experimental changes and
                        commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this state without impacting any
                        branches by performing another checkout.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Abort the merge: <code>git merge --abort</code></li>
            <li>About <code>git fetch</code>: In the simplest terms, git pull does a git fetch followed by a git merge.
                You can do a git fetch at any time to update your remote-tracking branches under refs/remotes/&lt;remote&gt;/.
                This operation never changes any of your own local branches under refs/heads, and is safe to do without
                changing your working copy.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Dong Liang's advice:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Use <code>git push â€“force</code> when updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is
                behind its remote counterpart. Note: do not use this in a team!
            </li>
            <li><code>Git reset --hard &lt;commit&gt;</code>: reset to a specified commit and ignore all the changes
                after this commit. equivalent to <code>git reset &lt;commit&gt;</code> + <code>git checkout .</code>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>About <code>console.log</code></h4>
        <p>[important] console.log is always a little "late" and you can't count on it when it comes to objects. Only
            primitives (strings etc.) will work directly. Of the former there is only one instance in memory, so when
            the console is fetching the data it may have changed already. <br>Solution: always remember to use <code>$log.debug</code>
            instead.</p>

        <h4>Some concepts about Git:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Head: the default position you are working with</li>
            <li>Origin: representation of the coding</li>
            <li>Master: the main branch of the product</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Aaron's advice:</h4>
        <p>Always use standard and formal sentences in the commit, starting with a verb. Never use a sentence like "hope
            it will work".</p>

        <h3>Jun 14th</h3>
        <h4>About Heroku</h4>
        <p>There are two ways to create an app on Heroku:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Add config files based on the tutorial with this URL: <i>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P86N9FqNqso&amp;index=2&amp;list=LLL_3tdfMBxvgcKjMzUfyy7w</i>;
                then navigate to the "add app" GUI page; finally link my website from github or gitlab to Heroku
            </li>
            <li>
                Add config files based on the tutorial with this URL: <i>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P86N9FqNqso&amp;index=2&amp;list=LLL_3tdfMBxvgcKjMzUfyy7w</i>;
                then use the Heroku command line to start the app: <i>https://devcenter.heroku.com/start?c=https://devcenter.heroku.com/start&amp;utm_campaign=Onboarding-Nurture-Email-1&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=nurture&amp;utm_content=devcenter&amp;utm_term=start-all</i>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Jun 16th</h3>
        <h4>About Heroku</h4>
        <p>There are two ways to edit/test Heroku apps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Use the Heroku command line tools:
                <ol>
                    <li>Input <code>heroku login</code></li>
                    <li>type in the credentials</li>
                    <li>Input <code>heroku local web</code></li>
                    <li>Enter the address <i>localhost:5000</i></li>
                </ol>
                and input this
                Note: this is for convenient local edit and test only
            </li>
            <li>
                Put the code and see the page on Internet:
                <ol>
                    <li>Use the procedures above, in the Assignment on Jun 14th</li>
                    <li>Push the code after modification</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
