		            	<p>Dear HR Officer of XXX,<br>Re: XXXXX | Auckland</p>
					</div>
					<div class="coverletter-paragraph">
						<p>I fall in love with coding for more than one year. One year is not a time long enough to make me a Guru or master, but it is surely long enough to make me get crazy about it.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="coverletter-paragraph row">
						<div class="col-8">
							<p>Funtown is the first project I took part in, it is a customized e-commerical platform developed by Avartar International Lt, in which I did my job as an intern. Thanks to my boss James and my supervisor Aaron, I learnt so much more than what I can put in my CV. And, most importantly, I gained my inexhaustible passion from my work.</p>

						</div>

						<div class="col-8">
							<p>To share my enthusiasm, I started making my own website. Originally, I was going to make it a fan website as well as sharing some coding experience. But I put so much my work reports, articles and my app scripts on it that I eventually made it my coding archive: In less than two months, I submitted about 200 commits, manually written over 3200 lines of code and report.</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="coverletter-paragraph row">
						<div class="col-8">
							<p>I am also interested in back-end skills and testing skills. Thus I embedded functional scripts into my website as much as I can. To further strengthen my scripting skills, I made mini apps with multiple functions, like the “Charles’ Business Card Manager”.</p>

						<div class="col-8">
							<p>I started another self-motivated project which is named by me as the “The Improvement Plan of Official Websites”. I viewed a lot of official websites from companies, forums and individuals. I studied their code and learnt so much from it. Therefore when I saw something I can do to make it better, I wrote down why it needs improvement, how it can become friendlier for users and eventually I wrote my code of solution.</p>
						</div>
					</div>

					<div class="coverletter-paragraph">
						<p>Dear HR Officer, I know I am not senior in this area. But can you feel the thrill when a man finally finds out what he loves most? I expand my skills in front-end, back-end and testing areas every day, literally. I started several self-motivated projects because participating in only one intern can no longer satisfy my hunger for knowledge. I kept practicing everyday, wishing eventually I can become a coder, as my life career.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="coverletter-paragraph">
						<p>That is all I would like to share beyond the CV, a dream with strong will to fulfill it. I might confront more difficulties in the future, but I won’t be defeated by them; I might be junior for now, but won’t be long. If you are interested in my work and believe I am the one or will become the one you are looking for, please contact me.</p>
